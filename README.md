# Urban Green Solutions - HTML & CSS Practice Project

## 🌿 About the Project

This project, **Urban Green Solutions**, is a practice exercise created while following Jonas Schmedtmann’s online course, **"Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS."** While the course provides the technical foundation, the **content, theme, and design are entirely my own**.

The project simulates a **fictitious sustainability company** that transforms urban spaces with green innovations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic and structured markup
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with flexbox and grid
- **Responsive Design** - Ensures adaptability across different screen sizes

## 📌 Purpose

This project is for **learning purposes only** and serves as a portfolio piece to showcase my ability to structure and style websites beyond the course's original furniture-related theme.
